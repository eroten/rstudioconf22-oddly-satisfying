## Document not only the **what**, but the **why**

We used 2019 AADT  
<!-- this is a factual statement, but doesn't tell us why  -->
<!-- But, we completed this update in 2021, after the 2020 data had been released? -->

other advice

- general bits of good advice
- specific way that I saw this in this problem
- I got this problem that was easy, but it wasn't -> good hook
- The truck becomes a plot device that can drive the story along
    - (maybe this big truck image that follows through)
    - most people won't be interested in the truck, 
- "I still don't care about trucks, but everyone in my office, go look at this thing because..."
- in the do-and-document
    - show what "we" did.
    - start with statements
    - here is what we did
    - *now* so when you do this, try this thing
- have the image of wrapping something up in a nice little box
- concrete examples
    - lean into the part of the person bringing your project
    - act into it -> the audience knows where this is going, so you can lean into it. 
    - I had to find the exciting stuff. It wasn't that easy, but I made it into a satisfying adventure. 
    
    better off with an "MP4", you get the media control.
