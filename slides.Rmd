## Complete an intake

- Read through everything - actually, everything

- Keep a list of all the things you dislike

<!-- You may find yourself in a place where the long-form PDF documentation doesn't align with what is happening in an Excel workbook -->
<!-- This is the time to resolve that, and start -->
- Replicate findings/results

other advice

- general bits of good advice
- specific way that I saw this in this problem
- I got this problem that was easy, but it wasn't -> good hook
- The truck becomes a plot device that can drive the story along
- (maybe this big truck image that follows through)
- most people won't be interested in the truck, 
- "I still don't care about trucks, but everyone in my office, go look at this thing because..."
- in the do-and-document
- show what "we" did.
- start with statements
- here is what we did
- *now* so when you do this, try this thing
- have the image of wrapping something up in a nice little box
- concrete examples
- lean into the part of the person bringing your project
- act into it -> the audience knows where this is going, so you can lean into it. 
- I had to find the exciting stuff. It wasn't that easy, but I made it into a satisfying adventure. 

better off with an "MP4", you get the media control.
